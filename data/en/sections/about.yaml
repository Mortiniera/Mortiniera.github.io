# a summary about you
summary: "I've spent over three years working as a Data Scientist, diving into different sectors like luxury goods and health and wellness. I've had the chance to grow in both fast-paced startup environments and big international companies.<br>What I love about Data Science is the chance to keep asking <b>why</b> and still having the chance to look for answers in the clearest way possible, all through data. <br><br>I'm big into open source and community platforms like Hugging Face, Stack Overflow and Kaggle. I believe these resources have truly made programming more accessible for everyone.<br>I advocate for fostering innovation through community-backed resources, which can lead to a broader understanding, help people distinguish real information from fake news and enable more informed decisions when faced with data or statistics.<br>I'm fascinated by how big tech trends like AI, cloud technologies, and blockchain are changing our world. I think a lot about how to make these advances fair and accessible to all and how to use them in a way that's sustainable for our planet.<br><br>I also enjoy playing and watching football, but not just for the game itself. I love how it brings people together, even if just for an hour or two. <br><br>I'm currently working on a side project and gathering feedback; I'd love to know about your main challenges and experiences using platforms such as Freelancer.com, Kaggle, StackOverflow and Quora, both as someone posting problems and as a problem solver.<br>"
